✅ Step 1: Implement Real Face Rotation Logic
When you rotate a face (e.g., F), not only should its own 3x3 tiles rotate, but also the edge rows or columns of adjacent faces must be rotated accordingly.

✅ Step 2: Solve the White Cross
We'll use logic to detect and move white edge pieces into place around the white center (U face). This can be hardcoded using position checks + moves.

✅ Step 3: Solve Full Cube Using Beginner’s Method
Step-by-step:

White cross

White corners

Middle layer edges

Yellow cross

Yellow corners

Permute yellow corners

Final edge rotation
